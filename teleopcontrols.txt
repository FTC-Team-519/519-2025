potential binds
Y button - shooter
B button - feed servo
LB+D pad right - zero all motors and servos involved with the shooter
LT+D pad right - Zero all motors involved with the intake and trey

Shooter: [on a joystick for ease of speed control] push the joystick forward to spin the black shooter wheels (pushing the stick a little bit for low speed and fill push for high speed)
or four different buttons for speeds like 25% 50% 75% and 100% but that might be too difficult to use effectively.
shooter: rotate spinner to next filled spot (color), spin up fly wheels to variable speed depending on distance, move servo to second (shooting position), the back to stored position

feeding servo: a button (Unknown) will start the motor with the green feed wheel [now referred to as the feed motor] while the servo underneath rotates the feed motor into shooting position.
pressing a button (either the same button or a different one) will turn the feed motor off and will rotate the feed motor out of the way for the balls to rotate.
